- 👋 Hi, I’m @DanaLenz, a computer science student at the RWTH university in Aachen, Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in C++ development, automated reasoning, knowledge representation, formal logics and related topics in AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on a little program for automated, preference based task scheduling (for a singular human person) based on existing OMT solvers.
